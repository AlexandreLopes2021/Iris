/**
 * chopÂ² (ChopChop): A high-performance frustum culling algorithm / implementation for voxel grids
 *
 * ChopChop is a (seemingly) novel algorithm that exploits properties of voxel grids
 * to efficiently determine the set of voxels that are contained within a given
 * frustum.
 *
 * ChopChop gets its name from the fact that it identifies the set of visible voxels by iteratively
 * "chopping" off voxels not contained within the planes of a frustum. This analytical approach
 * is far more efficient than the previous brute-force approach hacked on to Sodium's existing
 * chunk culling that iterates through chunks one-at-a-time due to a requirement of the
 * Advanced Cave Culling algorithm, which we have to disable in the shadow pass anyways.
